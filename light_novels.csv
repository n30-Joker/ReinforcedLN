Humankind learned to summon these dangerous mythical beings and used their power to great effect. Seven countries formed contracts with these ""gods"" and gained their allegiance as a result. Summoners on their 14th birthdays will be chosen by a God and given a stigma. Schools have been set up to train summoners and magical swordsmen as a result.  15 years later after the finding of magic, Kazuki Hayashizaki is chosen as a summoner and given a stigma to indicate that. It is surprising because males aren't chosen as summoners due to their low amount of mana compared to females. As the first male to become a summoner, Kazuki is under a lot of scrutiny by almost everyone.  To complicate matters, his sister who is a magical swordsman is against him going to summoner school to train there as a summoner. Because summoners and magical swordsman are in conflict where summoners think of magical swordsmen as inferior, his sister naturally is against him going there. She'll stop him even if it means going to war.  Kazuki, however, is determined to thrive in summoner school and is already determined to give it his all. Even if he's the lowest ranked student at Rank E and his fellow students intend to demean him, he'll prove himself as the strongest summoner.  (Source: MU)"

Magic abilities appear almost exclusively among young women, and usually disappears with age. However, these abilities are generally limited to raising a simple protective magic field, or moving objects slightly at a distance, or for some, flying on a broom. Then, in the 16th and 17 centuries, humanity entered into an age of discovery, highlighted by the Britannian witch Jamie Watt's invention of the magic engine, a steam-powered mechanical device which could boost a witch's natural magic powers several times over, which could then be used to drive all types of machinery. The magic engine was soon put to use in all forms of industry and transport, increasing production to levels previously thought impossible.  However, together with this huge increase in magic usage, sightings of the Neuroi, enigmatic lifeforms which had been spotted on scarce occasions for centuries, also began to increase exponentially. Appearing in countries all over the world, the Neuroi spread a noxious miasma, putrefying the land and consuming all types of metals, and they began encroaching on human territory. Normal soldiers could do nothing against that miasma, and humanity was on its last legs, with no choice but to retreat time and time again. It was then that it was discovered that a witch's protective field could block the miasma, and with the power of a magic engine, witches joined the battlefield. With the ability to easily wield weapons which would normally be far too heavy, imbue their attacks with magic, fly through the air freely, and block enemy attacks with magic fields, witches began to turn the tide against the Neuroi invasion. These witches, together with the Striker Units they wore, were known as ""Strike Witches"".  In 1939, as the European mainland faced the crisis of a Neuroi invasion of unprecedented scale, Imperial Army and Navy Witches from the far off Fuso Empire were sent to the battlefield as volunteer soldiers. One such Imperial Army Witch, Anabuki Tomoko, an ace and hero to the people after her outstanding service during the Neuroi raid known as the ""Fuso Sea Incident"", had been expecting to be sent to Karlsland, where the heaviest fighting was going on. However, she was instead deployed to the northernmost extreme of Europe, Suomus. There she meets the rest of her future fellow squadron members, none of whom had ever made a name for themselves in their former countries, instead being treated nearly like outcasts, half-baked witches without any talent or motivation. It's now up to the ""Misfits Squadron"", or officially the ""Suomus Independent Volunteer Air Squadron"", to find out how they can stand up to the Neuroi menace.  (Source: Baka-Tsuki)"

Mariela, one such alchemist, lives in a small cottage between Citadel City and the Fell Forest, where dangerous beasts lurked; she spends her peaceful days producing and selling potions.   One day, disaster strikes when a flood of monsters destroy Citadel City as well as the Kingdom of Endalsia—an incident later known as the Stampede. Out of desperation, the young alchemist hides in her cellar and freezes her body in time. However, a clumsy mistake puts her in an accidental slumber for two hundred years, only to wake up in a vastly different world: one where alchemists are all but extinct.  She is discovered by members of the Black Iron Freight Corps, who befriend her and escort her to Labyrinth City, the former Citadel City. Due to the Stampede, no new pact bearers have appeared in the past two hundred years, causing undue hardship for everyone. The arrival of Mariela sparks hope for a new era as her bubbly personality quickly wins people over.

It follows the adventures of Honoka, a 17 year old girl who is human, but was born with a blue third eye as well. The Third found that she could not interface with the rest of The Third and so declared her a mutation and left her with human parents. Her blue eye enables her to see Chi and use it to find cloaked enemies and sense the emotions of all living things. Honoka is a jack-of-all-trades who travels throughout the barren earth with the help of a sand tank operated by Bogie, an AI guardian given to her by her grandfather. She earns a living by doing various jobs with the tank like ridding areas of oversized spiders and ants and escorting or transporting clients. One night while traveling through the desert, she comes upon a strange man named Iks. He arrived on the planet for a purpose which is not clear until the last episode.

During travel or at night, she recites poems by a writer named ""Dona Myfree"" (exact spelling unknown at this time)."

One day, Mei Satou arrived at Shiori's house as a roommate. Mei, who kept her heart closed to everyone, confided in Shiori about her purpose in coming to this town.  ""I want to slaughter all seven people who drove my sister to death.""  Three years ago, Mei's sister, Akari, had taken her own life after experiencing horrendous bullying in this town. Mei had returned here for the sake of revenge. Mei planned to carry out the bloodstained ritual ""Okakashitsutsumi,"" passed down at the Agata Shrine, and house the giant snake god ""Okakashisama"" within herself to execute the plan of killing the seven individuals.  On the night of the summer solstice, Mei successfully performed the ritual. From that point onward, one by one, Mei, with the power of the god, began killing the individuals involved in her sister's death, alongside Shiori. Amidst the days of revenge and escape, the two gradually developed romantic feelings for each other. However, Mei had a hidden truth from Shiori: those who performed ""Okakashitsutsumi"" must ultimately offer their own souls to the god, meaning Mei's death was inevitable.

She wants to achieve this with her own strength as her lifelong dream, and to her, the first step to accomplishing this dream just came her way with the appearance of her own crest.

Dimitar's aunt, Orvieto Richternach, assures Valeria that he will never lay a hand on her—because Dimitar only has eyes for older women.

The AI Sophia, announces to the confused class that as the caretaker of the remaining humans, she will provides all of their living necessaries, incomes, and personal safety- as long as they keep their newly found metal bracelet on their wrist.  The class will become a “nation” inside the room, and the bracelet is akin to one’s citizenship.  Taking off one’s bracelet means that the person surrenders his position in the class and all but the most basic living necessities. In return to this, however, one can exit through the only exit door in this room, as that person is no longer part of the nation. Once outside, the double doors will lock up and that person shall never enter the room again. There will be no food, no water, no recourse for that individual.  Ryuuki, who always has problems with authority, took off his bracelet upon hearing that. From that moment on, he became an outsider of the class, one who sees everything as an observer and viewed by others as a lecher of resources.  As the days become months, the friction between the class and Ryuuki heats up. But this is not the only thing the class has to worry about. It turns out that their “nation” is only one of the 8 forces on a giant 2D game board, where the winner takes all the resources, leaving the losers virtually nothing.  Who are the other forces? Who is the AI? Was there really a nuclear war? What will become of our main character? Will he leave the room? What will he find outside?  (Source: Crazy Cake)"

Mafia groups hire Kung Fu masters and dominate the society.  There are two types of Kung Fu masters, those who mastered their internal qi, and those who mastered their physical skills. The qi masters are able to output a stronger energy coming from their life itself, but it took a long time to master it. It was easier to just train their physical skills, but there was a limit to how strong a human body can be. So there were a balance of many average physical skill masters and few strong qi masters. However that balance broke when cybernetics came into play. Kung Fu masters would replace their body with robotic parts and attain a strength that a normal human can never achieve. That's how no one tried to become qi masters anymore when they can easily become powerful by using cybernetics, and qi masters decreased in numbers.  The main character of the story Kong Taoluo, a qi master, used to be the top assassin of the leading mafia group. He was betrayed and killed, or at least he was supposed to be, but now he returns to city of Shanghai for revenge and for his sister...  (Source: VNDB)"

Devastated in the aftermath of defeat, the Japanese government complies with the Allies' reconstruction plan. Japan begins to recover from the loss after a few years, but America and China intricately divide the nation on a municipal level. Eventually, China's military districts become Chinatowns, and places controlled by the United States are Americanized. The many Chinese and American immigrants make Japanese people the minority in their own land. Some Japanese are unwilling to accept this fate and secretly gather their strength to challenge the new system.  A girl named Rose Haibara works at the club Primavera and lends money to Japanese people so that they can rebuild their lives. Meanwhile, Leo Shishigami is best known for his reputation among women. Everything begins to change when that legendary man meets Rose in the spring of 1947."

He wasn't like that when he was little, but changed with adulthood. As soon as someone around him was showing too much interest toward him, trying to pray into his past, he would immediately change his address and work in order to reset everything. And above all, he used to keep his mouth shut about that little something he was able to do, and that no one else around could. Not that anyone would believe him anyway. It would just make others ostracize him for being creepy.  Because Takumi can see ghosts, and freely talk with them as well. Forget about the misconception that ghost are full of hatred or other ill feelings. They aren't. They're actually often nicer than they were while they were still alive, as if dying and being liberated from their body washed away that kind of things, only leaving some lingering feelings stopping them from moving on.  But isolating himself from others is no longer an option. Takumi is now a new employee in a company where everyone is like him. They use that little something others don't have to work for insurance companies and police behind the scenes, asking the ghost directly for the circumstances of their death, unofficially leading the cases toward their rightful conclusion. And also, part of the pride of this job is to help those ghosts to pass on after they completed the insurance company or police request.  As a new employee, Takumi will have to learn from his seniors how to understand them, and deal with their lingering feelings, one way or another. But can someone who rejected others for all those years really understand how they feel?"

With his hard work and natural intuition of the market, his seed money of one thousand mools grows to seventy-two thousand mools in a matter of months, with the end to his streak nowhere in sight.  Unfortunately, despite the Moon being an economic paradise with limited regulations and low taxes, street urchins like Yoshiharu must always remain on the lookout.

As their growing success both in and out of the competition leads to more people investing in Haru and his goal, will he be able to keep his cool and stay on top of the ever-volatile market?

As people began moving from Europe to the New World in the latter half of the fifteenth century, the non-humans took over England. In order to create a safe haven for them, the gods and demons that left them there cut England away from reality and sealed it inside of a book.  The various species that once existed tangibly are now in the fictional England, therefore making them ""fictional"" beings. As a book, England has a cover known as Heaven and a back cover known as Hell. Between those are nine chapter title pages, the same number as there are orders of angels. From the moment you set foot in that foreign land, your form and emotions are expressed in writing. Humans rarely have a chance to enter that space.  In that same city, three humans—Valeath, Ralf, and Moyla—invade. The demons are killed one-by-one, their voices beginning to be extinguished.

The Hero soon comes to realise through his missions and association with his leaders that the corruption within the Empire's top tier has led to a country whose populace is enslaved and unhappy.  Through his friend Ted, he comes into possession of the Rune of Life and Death (also known as the Soul Eater), one of 27 True Runes that govern various aspects of the world. The Rune, ruthlessly hunted for by corrupt officials within the Empire and their manipulators, force the Hero and his companions to flee the capital city of Gregminster.  This early chain of events forces the Hero to cross paths with a rebel organization where he is sheltered, although he is only convinced of the need to struggle against the Empire when the hideout is attacked and sacked by Imperial forces.

Arshtat's husband Ferid pulls her back to her senses, and she dismisses the inspection party with a whisper.  The next issue of contention is the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held somewhat early for the ten-year old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing themselves with a champion, hail from rival noble houses: The foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fiance, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified.  However, Lord Marscal Godwin, Gizel's father, is less than impressed with Gizel's activities, thinking that he has made an enemy of the Prince and the royal family as a whole with his plotting. Additionally, the royal family took Zegai, the Barows champion, into their own personal custody, who could perhaps help reveal the Godwins cheating and offer an excuse to annul the engagement. Thus, the Godwins launch a preemptive attack at the engagement ceremony in Sol-Falena, Falena's capital. Arshtat and Ferid had anticipated and prepared for the attack, but not the involvement of the elite Nether Gate assassins, who overwhelm the palace's defenses. The struggle culminates in Arshtat and Ferid's deaths, while Lymsleia finds herself a captive. The Prince Ardil, Lyon, Georg, and Sialeeds are forced to flee."

It was so needlessly realistic that it was already basically a VR life simulator.  As for anything game-like, it was basically limited to weapon masteries; a proficiency level that you got from using your weapon, as well as physical strength that increased as well. That was it.  It was a fantasy game so there was magic, but forming a contract with a spirit was extremely difficult, and only 1% of the playerbase were magicians.  In this VR game DEMONDAL that was ridiculously close to reality, the protagonist Kei who was a well known mounted archery expert, was one day sent to another world with his Russian DEMONDAL friend.

In the span of two generations the town was built up to the status of prestige it now commands, an expansion helmed by the Hadou Group, an industrial complex and family dynasty currently run by the young Hadou Ruri. She pursues the peace and prosperity of Arkham diligently, against the forces of darkness threatening to plunge the city, and the world, back into a second dark age. Among the most sinister threats to Arkham City is the evil Black Lodge syndicate. Led by the charismatic Master Therion, his nihilistic outlook shapes the group's destructive goals: with a circle of powerful sorcerers at his command, the potential for sowing chaos in the city is unmatched.  Former Miskatonic University Magic Academy student Daijuuji Kurou knows little of grimoires, but what he does know terrifies him - enough that he left his university life behind, and now practices a failing detective business in the shelter of an orphanage in a quiet corner of Arkham. But just when he thought his Academy past was buried, it catches up with him and pulls him back into the dark shadows of the occult: Hadou Ruri herself appears at his door with an offer he can't refuse. The only way to combat the Black Lodge's growing magical power is to find, and retrieve, a grimoire with the power to activate the mightiest Machina of all: Demonbane. The quest to find this forbidden tome will change Kurou's destiny... forever.  (Source: VNDB)"

Many rumors surround the mysterious building, including those of monsters living inside, people who venture in and never return, and even ghosts. But such tales are surely fiction. Or are they?  Shun, a shy transfer student at the local middle school, is a lonely kid who spends his time making a freeware game. He ends up at the Jailhouse after being bullied by a popular and seemingly nice student named Takurou whose father owns the building. As he enters the mansion with Takurou, Shun is joined by his friends, the brainy Hiroshi and Anna, the kindhearted class president. Takurou's lackey, Takeshi, and Takurou's girlfriend Mika also accompany them. But once inside, they are unable to leave, and they come face to face with the blue monsters inhabiting the Jailhouse. But even stranger is the fact that their experiences in the mansion play out just like Shun's game. Armed with this knowledge, can they survive their ordeal, or will they end up with a ""game over"" in real life?  [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Tullius, the second son of an earl's family, died in modern-day Japan and was reincarnated as a child in a fantasy world ruled by swords and magic. His only wish is simple: ""I never want to die again."" Having experienced the terror of death once, he is even more afraid of dying than most. He refuses to accept dying from old age, illness, or being killed by others.  Driven by this obsession, he clings to alchemy, a form of magic that is said to grant immortality when perfected.

His repeated, abnormal experiments make him feared and reviled by those around him, but he doesn't care at all.

In fact, Marietta is infatuated with the grizzled Belvant, and swoons at the idea of their marriage. But for some reason, people keep misinterpreting the couple. To others, Marietta's lovesickness seems like fear, and though Belvant is truly kind, he appears uncaring and brutish.

For Audrey, erotic games had been wish-fulfilling fantasies for a virgin such as herself. However, from her knowledge of the game, she knows that if she does not sleep with someone, she is doomed to die at the hands of a yandere love interest. To prevent such an unfortunate end, Audrey enlists the aid of her bodyguard Calfan to teach her bedroom manners.   On the other hand, the ""romances"" which await the heroine are horrifying and nonconsensual. So much so, she has been training since childhood to become stronger. As Flora nears 18 years of age, the start of the visual novel's storyline comes closer as well, and she can't seem to avoid encounters with the love interests. At least her butler Karl is not a pursuable character, and he is more than willing to help protect her innocence from any lascivious male.  Otome Game de Shinitakunai n desu follows Audrey and Flora as they navigate a treacherous world, where any man may be hiding lecherous intentions and fetishes behind handsome smiles.

In an age where humans had still yet to establish a system of writing. It's said that there existed a Magus in a country named Scarlet. It's said that he imparted knowledge concerning language and writing, taught how to cultivate the lands, instructed the ways of raising animals, and brought about the gift—nay, the magic of fire. It's said that he was a dauntless youth, a dragon clad in scarlet red scales, a person worshiped far and wide. It's said that this man was the God of Civilization. Yet strangely, his name had been virtually wiped from the records. Therefore, he was simply referred to as—The Magus of Genesis.  (Source: Zirus Musings)"

Separated and summoned inside a vast dungeon, where the only way to escape is to head to the deepest area, they are given the power of a Divine Protection ""Vocation"" as the only means of survival. While some of them are brave, some just do whatever they want, and some harbor treacherous intentions, they all aim to capture the dungeon.  In this place, one person gained a ""Vocation"" whose skills are unsuitable for combat, attendance number 19, Momokawa Kotarou. A boy with a small and lean build from the Literature Club wasn't blessed with a physical ability, swordsmanship, or strong magic, rather he only had the ""Shaman"" vocation to rely on.  After being driven out of the group and left behind by his powerful classmates—his survival instinct starts running at full throttle! Pushed to the limit of survival in the different world's dungeon, what starts with trusting and loving each other soon ends in killing and betrayal.  The most beautiful and gruesome battle royal has raised its curtain.  (Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, Novel Updates)"

I can freely bend the power of thunder to my will, so people have taken to calling me the ""Lightning Warrior"". Why am I standing here in front of this tower, you ask? The cause lies in the village of Saad that I visited recently. I got there to find it in decay, deserted and transformed almost completely into a ghost town...  Apparently it became that way due to the monsters living in this tower. They'd been stealing away all of the young maidens from the village, and none of the men who went to rescue them ever returned... a harsh and terrible tale. Being who I am I couldn't hear that story and stand by idle, so now I find myself here, facing the tower.  (Source: G-Collections)"

Thus the leader of the ninja clans has delegated his most favored son with the important and coveted task of neutralizing the kunoichi. Traditional law demands their immediate execution, but the significance of cryptic information and secret techniques the girls possess makes live capture for interrogation too valuable an alternative to disregard. Thus Takame goes forth to accomplish his orders and ""rehabilitate"" the wayward ninja.  (Source: VNDB)"

However, Yuki gets the mind shaken as Kenji and Hiyori become intimate, and the pain in her mind in the childhood is recalled.  At the childhood, Yuki was going to pass the light blue toy ring which Kenji had had to Hiyori in exchange for Hiyori's yoyo. However, because Hiyori became sick, and had moved, the promise was not an accomplishment. Their events in the childhood seem to be related to Hiyori's showing up in front of them. A painful love story of Kenji and two girls progresses.  (Source: AniDB)"

One day while he was going home he stumbled upon a girl being bullied by magic students. He decided to intervene but before he manages to do so, the other party lost interest and left. He then went to the now alone girl and apologized on their behalf as a wizard.  The girl asked if he's a wizard and implored him to teach her magic. Naturally he refused and told her to go enroll to the magic academy. She told her that she was a student there but was expelled due to a lack of magic potential. Since magic potential is innate and can't be changed he told her to give it up and went back on his way home.  While thinking during his way home, he realized that girl look tattered and is standing near a Wizard's society building. Thinking that the girl must have been standing there for days in order to find a mentor, he decided to go back to her.  Seeing the girl still on the same place, he asked her if she really wanted to become a wizard no matter what. But before she can answer she collapsed due to exhaustion so Lazlocke took her home.  He nursed her back to health and completely recovered several days later. He then asked her to explain her situation.  Her name is Celestine Rococo, her father is the head of the Rococo family, a prestigious magic family. One day his apprentice killed him and took over as the head. In order to avenge her father and take her rightful position as the family head, she vowed to become a wizard and enrolled at the magic academy. Unfortunately she had no magic potential and the academy kicked her out after not showing progress for 3 months.  Pitiful of her plight, Lazlocke asked the society to look in her situation. The society responded by saying that the apprentice is only taking the head position temporarily and promised to step down once the rightful person has shown talents befitting that of a head. Furthermore, the society promises to acknowledge Celestine's capability as a head if she manages to win the Queenberg magic rally due in 3 years.  And thus begins Lazlocke and Celestine's mentor-apprentice relationship. Will she manage to win the fated tournament?  (Source: VNDB)"

The next day is Valentine's Day and at school, all the girls are giving their gifts to the boys of their choice. Later that day, Anri challenges Haruhi to a magic battle in order to take the chocolate she has by force for the reason that Haruhi wouldn't tell her who she was going to give it to. Before long, Anri loses control of her magic and it is flown outside, almost falling onto Yuuma and his friends. Ultimately, Haruhi gives him the chocolate she had bought, and in turn Anri does the same, which was her plan - to give her chocolate to the same boy as Haruhi and see who would win his favor more. The next day there is a gas explosion at the magic section of the school and all the mages in training must transfer over to the normal section for the time being. Coincidentally, Haruhi and Anri are placed within Yuuma's class.  Now Haruhi and her friends must adjust to the transfer into the normal section of Mizuhosaka Academy.  (Source: Wikipedia)"

Such children inherit the unfulfilled ambitions, beliefs and feelings of their previous lives, and are hence called ""Revenge Children"". Despite becoming a hot topic there were still many who doubted their existence, and as a result the Revenge Children became a myth of the town, eventually disappearing from people's minds.  Ten-odd years later... Out of the blue, Mizuki Ouma, who claims to be the Revenge Child of Oda Nobunaga, declares intent for world unification. Japan falls into her hands.  But Mizuki is pushed down by Takuma Sumeragi, the main protagonist plagued with an abnormal sex drive, after an unexpected incident, and this and that were done. As a result, her battle flag is stolen. Mizuki is left with the deep scar of failure.  With a dented pride, a Mizuki burning with revenge targeted at Takuma wants to settle the score once and for all through Takuma's area of expertise: sex. She involves the other Revenge Children, and with both her pride and Japan on the line, commences a war of sex.  A lewd world wet with love juices and semen thus began.  (Source: VNDB)"

What was with her lately?  We'd always gotten along. However, these days we barely even spoke. It's true I was working more often and she was coming into her own as a young woman, but... I still loved her as my little sister.  She seemed to be more irritable as she got more beautiful. This spring she had started dating someone.

The question is how to achieve this..... Then came a night where our parents went on a work holiday, and it was just Aoi and me. Alone in the house together, I can make her do whatever I say.

Given free access to all areas of campus, Yokoya installed cameras so he could observe all the young, lithe bodies. ""It's a coach's duty to watch over their sexual development,"" he told himself. Today, after classes and clubs had ended, he was watching footage of gym class and masturbating.  Yokoya was slowly stroking to the footage when his cell phone rang. He left the room to answer, and when he came back, student Ryoko Misaki was standing there. She had some papers clutched in her hand, staring at the spy monitor.  If Yokoya let Misaki leave the room she'd tell everyone. Caught in a predicament, he made the decision to educate her into silence. Students rarely obey teachers, but he would be... thorough.

Although the Revolution brought with it new laws and some semblance of representative government, there are some places that never change: the dark hole known as prison. Into that hell a boy called Guys is sent. The crime is murder, and the sentence, life without the possibility of parole.  However, Guys is innocent of this crime. He was living his life as he always did, running through the city and stealing to survive when he was caught by a policeman. Before he knew what was happening he was accused of a crime he knew nothing about, hauled before a dishonest judge and found guilty of the heinous crime. But just who was killed, and why?  In prison, Guys is made to endure a world of violence and betrayal as he fights desperately to survive. Inside that world of fear and loathing, he endures in his quest for justice for himself. He finds help in unlikely places—from alcoholic lawyers and insane men in the prison with him. Eventually, he begins to realize the scope of the diabolical plot he's fallen into, but even as he works to uncover the truth, he despairs of that which he has lost. And every day, he struggles for dignity and survival, while the powerful interests who put him here look on with smirking amusement.  ""I just want to be free...""  Will his strength and determination be enough to break through the hearts of his fellow prisoners? Will he be able to finally uncover the truth and find salvation?  (Source: VNDB)"

The king tried to escape with his son, whereas the princess who was left behind was captured by the enemy. Alone, the general gave chase and managed to catch up to the king and the prince. The king fought the general, telling the prince that he had to run away, otherwise he’d be killed and the lineage of dragon would be eliminated. When the prince hesitated to run away, the king was mortally struck… and used his last energy to teleport the prince elsewhere, so that he was saved from the general.  The prince was found by a girl and her father, and was nursed back to health. However, everything that happened had crippled his spirit, and he didn’t have any wish to go and reclaim his kingdom. He was content to live with the girl and her father.  But the general’s soldiers were still looking for him. One day they happened upon the house, and the girl’s father tried to protect the prince… and was killed. Before the soldier could go and kill him and the girl, he unleashed a power which killed all of the soldiers. This power was something he had for being of the dragon lineage, and is not something he could freely control.  Afterwards, they buried the girl’s father… and the girl begged him to travel together. She wanted to get revenge for her father. Soon after, girls from various places and status joined him in his quest to reclaim the kingdom… to ultimately fulfill an old prophecy. Because there was an old prophecy that said that when the kingdom was in peril, it will be saved by someone of the dragon lineage and his queen.  (Source: VNDB)"

Here, beings called the ""Kannagi no Tori"" (or Birds of Kannagi) live, and it is their job to take the souls of the people who die to Kannagi-san, where they can then pass on to the world of the dead. The ""Kannagi no Tori"" get sent out just before someone dies to retrieve their soul and bring it back.  However, one ""Kannagi no Tori,"" Ikaru, is different. He feels wrong about death, and typically when he is sent out instead of letting the death take place and retrieving the soul, he usually interferes with fate by preventing an accident, convincing someone not to commit suicide, or rescuing the person in danger to save their life. He still has not retrieved a single soul. He is given a ""final mission"" to prove himself as a ""Kannagi no Tori,"" and if he fails, he will cease to exist.  His mission is to retrieve the soul of a young boy, Watanaki Ruu, who is to die in a car accident on the first of June, in about one month. Over this month Ikaru has several interactions with Ruu and his family, and feels an usual tie to Ruu, and doesn't want to take his soul... but his fellow ""Kannagi no Tori"" friends are trying to make sure he gets his mission done because they don't want to see their friend cease to exist, and at the same time, they have missions of their own involving people around Ruu as well.  Will Ikaru be able to finish his mission, or will he be unable to claim this soul as well...?  (Source: Boys' Love Games Headquarters)"
